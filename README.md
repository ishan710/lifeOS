# LifeOS Agentic Backend

This project is a scalable, modular backend for LifeOS, focused on agentic AI workflows. It is designed for extensibility, async operation, and easy integration with LLMs and agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI).

## Key Features
- Modular agent architecture (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
- Intent recognition and entity extraction
- Central orchestrator for workflow management
- Async FastAPI API layer
- Easily extensible for new agents, LLMs, and integrations
